<h3 class="Roboto">10 things that are good to make:</h3>

<br>

<ol class="Roboto">

  <li>Bread shaped like animals, very cute, very creative, very good.</li>
  <br>
  
  <li>A handprint painting. Nothing is more fun than putting paint all over your hand and making your mark. Activates caveman brain. 10/10. </li>
  <br>
  
  <li>Pesto. That’s all. </li>
  <br>
  
  <li>Little clay things. If they’re kind of creepy looking, bury them in your backyard as a nice surprise for anyone who owns your house in the future :).  
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh those weird blind contour drawings. Those are always a great way to humble yourself.  
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>Stuffed animals made of socks. Make them as ugly as humanly possible. 
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>Handwritten madlibs. Make them serious or silly, but they’ll almost certainly turn out silly. There’s nothing you can do about that.  
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>Homemade pasta. It may taste gross, but you’ll feel like a lovely old Italian man with one of those mustaches that curls at the end. You know the one.  
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>A drawing of your favorite movie villain but give them sunglasses to make them cooler.  
  </li>
  <br>

  <li>A list of bad ideas/ mistakes. Look back at your old mistakes, laugh, and make sure you don’t accidently repeat them. Only repeat mistakes on purpose.  </p>
  </li>

</ol>
